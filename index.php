                We believe in the value of sport in a balanced life, and we strive for every pupil to gain the fullest benefit from their sporting experience at Oundle. Whether your goal is leisure or high-level competition, our programme supports the whole team, celebrating individual milestones and collective progress alike, from junior and inter swimmers stepping up in ESSA relays and mixed events to seniors grinding through back to back races, from long away days to Warwick to a recent national finals berth in water polo, and with swimmers who have reached nationals. We’re proud to have swimmers competing at the highest levels while also focusing on every swimmer’s development and the strength of the squad.
